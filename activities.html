				<h1>Activities</h1>
				<br>
				<p>Belgrade and it’s surroundings offer quite a large variety of activities in air, land and water alike. You can do anything from a relaxing walk, fishing or yachting to more adrenalin boosting activities such as hiking, rock-climbing, cycling through one of it’s many parks and forests, swim, water-ski, go bungee jumping, skating, paragliding and many more.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Many of these activities are centred around Ada Ciganlija, a man-made island turned peninsula. During hot summer days, thousands of citizens of Belgrade come here to cool down, swim and have fun on the peninsula surrounded by the Sava River and Sava Lake. That is how the nickname “Belgrade’s seaside” was created, through everyday visits to the well-maintained and attractive beaches which adorn the biggest and best looking swimming and picnic spot of the capital.</p>

				<h2>Waterskiing</h2>
				<br>
				<p>Water skiing is a sport that is played in the surface of the water. Water skiing was developed by Ralph Samuelson in the 1920's. He used a pair of boards to ski, and a clothesline as a towrope. Usually, a rider is pulled behind a boat or pulled by a cable ski installation. Riders skim the surface using one (slalom) or two skis. Most of the time, the double skis are used by beginners, and then they progress to a single ski.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The water ski-lift is a first-class tourist attraction and a must-visit sports, recreational and entertainment complex of the city of Belgrade.The complex is open throughout the year, while the skiing season starts from mid-April and lasts until mid-October. During this period, more than 5,000 beginners learn to ski every year.</p>

				<h2>Sport Climbing</h2>
				<br>
				<p>The artificial rock is located on the left bank of the Lake Sava, near the round bath. Its height is 15 meters with a capacity of 15 paths – directions. Sports climbing allows for daily pushing of the boundaries of possible, combining adrenaline experience, psychological stability, participation of the entire musculature and the beauty of soft, graceful climbing. Although sport climbing is one of the extreme sports, injuries are very rare, provided that the climber obeys the basic rules of safety.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Sport Climbing Club “Vertikal” was founded in 1994 and is a member of the Mountaineering Association of Serbia. The “Vertikal” club with its artificial rock at Ada Ciganlija is the climbing center of competitive events and gatherings of new members. This is available to anyone game enough to face its challenge</p>
